Lecture 05– Homework04  Using database db03
5 points 1 thru 6
10 ponts 7 thru 14
20 points.  Alter, Begin, Rollback
130 points possible. 
This is a continuation of todays classwork.   Include the classwork problems in this submission
Use the database file db03
Name the file ‘04Homework.txt’
For this project you will perform the indicated actions using insert, update, or delete
After each  numbered operation is complete, you will execute a query ( provided) to check you work.
Do not use a surrogate key in any command, unless the instructions say you can.
Note change from db02.  There is an employeeNumber which is unique.
IMPORTANT:
At the beginning of your input file – put the following commands ( before any others)
ALTER SEQUENCE employee_id_seq RESTART WITH 20;
ALTER SEQUENCE meeting_id_seq RESTART WITH 120;
BEGIN;
After the last query.  Put the following command 
ROLLBACK;
Doing this will allow you to run your file multiple times without negatively affecting the 
database.
1 – Add a new employee  
Name = ‘Farquar’  WorkPhone = 9876  HomePhone 3333
 EmployeeID 'X476543'
Do not set the id yourself.  Let the system do that for you.
This should consist of two insert commands.  You may use the returned ID from the first command in the 
second command.
Query:
SELECT employeenumber, employee.name  , phoneType.name, 
PhoneInfo.Number 
FROM Employee
    JOIN PhoneInfo  ON ( employee.id = phoneInfo.employeeid)
    JOIN PhoneType ON ( phoneType.id = phoneInfo.type)
WHERE employee.name ILIKE 'F%';
2 – Add two new employees in a single statement
Name = ‘Amy’  EmployeeNumber = ‘X412345'
Name = ‘Bert’  EmployeeNumber = 'X412346'
Query:
SELECT employeenumber, employee.name  
FROM Employee
WHERE Employeenumber like 'X4%'
ORDER BY employeenumber;
3 – Add phone numbers for Amy
Pager ( P)  ‘345-3456’
Business (B) ‘123-4567
Do NOT use employee.ID in any of your commands. 
Query:
SELECT employeenumber, employee.name  , phoneType.name as PhoneType, 
PhoneInfo.Number 
FROM Employee
    JOIN PhoneInfo  ON ( Employee.id = phoneInfo.employeeid)
    JOIN PhoneType ON ( phoneType.id = phoneInfo.type)
WHERE employee.employeenumber  LIKE 'X4%'
ORDER BY employeenumber, phoneType;
4-Change Amy’s name ( EmployeeNumber  X412345) to ‘Ardvark’
Do NOT use employee.ID in any of your commands. 
Query:
SELECT employeenumber, employee.name  
FROM Employee
WHERE Employeenumber like 'X4%'
order by employeenumber;
5 – Delete the employee with employeNumber = ‘X412346';
Query:
SELECT employeenumber, name
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeNumber  LIKE 'X4%'
ORDER BY NAME;
6 – Delete Employee ‘X412345’ from the database
This will take two commands.  One to delete the phoneInfo, one to delete the employee record
Query:
SELECT employeenumber, name
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeNumber  LIKE 'X4%'
ORDER BY NAME;
7 – Add two new employees
Name = ‘New1’  EmployeeID = ‘X498765'
Name = ‘New2  EmployeeID = 'X498989’'
Add both in a single command;
Query:
SELECT employeenumber, name 
FROM Employee
WHERE name ilike 'New%'
ORDER BY EmployeeNumber;
8 – Give New1 and New2 a phone  number
Business (B) 123-4567 for both employees.
Do this in a single command
Query:
SELECT employeenumber, employee.name  , phoneType.name, 
PhoneInfo.Number 
FROM Employee
    JOIN PhoneInfo  ON ( Employee.id = phoneInfo.employeeid)
    JOIN PhoneType ON ( phoneType.id = phoneInfo.type)
WHERE employee.employeeNumber like 'X4%'
ORDER BY employee.employeeNumber;
9 – Create a new meeting
Purpose = ‘New Employee Orientation’
RoomNumber  104
Building ‘A’
StartTime ‘2019-04-05 at 3:00 PM’
Duration  one hour
Created by ‘Sarah’ ( ‘X311234’)
Moderated by ‘Ariel ( ‘X311239’)
Do this in a single command
Query:
SELECT room.roomNumber, building, startTime, duration, purpose, 
employee.name as creator
FROM Meeting
    JOIN room ON ( room.id = meeting.roomid)
    JOIN employee ON ( employee.id = meeting.creatorid)
ORDER BY starttime ;
10 – Add Employees to the new meeting you just created 
EmployeeIDs 'X476543', 'X498765', 'X498989'
There is only one Meeting that has a purpose of ‘New %’ Use that to find the correct meeting.
Do this in one command.
Query:
SELECT name, employeenumber 
FROM Employee
    JOIN Attendees ON Employee.id = Attendees.employeeid
    JOIN Meeting  ON Meeting.id = Attendees.meetingid
WHERE Meeting.purpose like 'New%'
ORDER BY NAME;
11 – Move the time of all staff meetings 30 minutes into the future
Query:

FROM Employee
    JOIN Attendees ON Employee.id = Attendees.employeeid
    JOIN Meeting  ON Meeting.id = Attendees.meetingid
WHERE Meeting.purpose like 'New%'
ORDER BY NAME;
13 – Change the moderator for the ‘New Employee %’ meeting to Albert ( ‘X311248’)

WHERE meeting.purpose like 'New%';
14 – For every meeting that Albert ( ‘X311248’) is moderator, change to Max ( ‘X311237’)
Query:
SELECT meeting.purpose, employee.name, employee.employeenumber
FROM meeting
    JOIN employee ON  meeting.moderatorid = employee.id
WHERE employee.employeenumber IN ( 'X311248', 'X311237')
ORDER BY  meeting.starttime;
